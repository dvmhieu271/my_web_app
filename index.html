    <p>
    I was a student of VNUK since 2016. My specialized is Computer Science Engineering. When I graduated, I'll work at my uncle company. It's just a small company, but people are friendly. My current part-time job is waiter at a coffee shop. The salary isn't high neither low. I think I will be fine with it, atleast I'm alive :D
